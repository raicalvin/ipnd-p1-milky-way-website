      <h3>Our Galaxy</h3>

        <p>Our Milky Way Galaxy consists of a giant bulge in the center, spiral arms encompassing a disk shape, and global clusters scattered throughout the disk. Our galaxy is home to over 100 billion stars and is about 100,000 light-years in diameter (about 590,000,000,000,000,000 miles wide!). Our star, the Sun, is located about 27,000 light-years away from the bulge (or the center) of our galaxy. Astonishingly, the Sun and all its orbiting objects orbit the center of the galaxy at nearly 220 km/sec. Yes, per second!</p>

      <h3 id="starDeath">Star Death</h3>

      <div class="boxPlanetaryNebula">
        <p>Stars are formed in areas of cool and dense gas. These regions, called molecular clouds, are so cold and dense, they allow molecules to form from closely interacting atoms. Just as with anything being born, it must also, one day, die. When a star's life ends, it returns much of its mass into interstellar space through a planetary nebula. This famous one captured by the Hubble Space Telescope, the <em>Cat's Eye Nebula</em>, is dying star that is about 1.2 light-years in diameter.</p>

      <h3>Milky Way Center...</h3>

        <p>So what does lie at the center of our Milky Way? Much of our view of the center of the Milky Way is blocked by interstellar dust that obscures our view. Using other forms of light waves, such as gamma, X-ray and infrared, we find within 1000 light-years of the center a swirling ocean of gas and star clusters housing millions of stars. Studying the motion of these stars and objects around the center lead us to believe the presence of a highly massive object: a black hole.</p>
